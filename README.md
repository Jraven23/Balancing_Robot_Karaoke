# Balancing_Robot_Karaoke
The project is purely recreational and meant for learning and applying my knowledge about control theory and microcontrollers. The balancing robot is an inverted pendulum system built using scrap parts I found at home, the box of a karaoke, some Lipo batteries, an arduino nano, stepper motors NEMA17, an IMU6050 and two cat plates as wheels.
